## About this project

Because our app has so many features, and serves so many personas and use cases, many users find the current onboarding process overwhelming, and don’t experience their “a ha” moment quickly enough.

This quarter, the user education team is investing in a holistically redesigned onboarding flow, with a goal of increasing 7 day retention by 25%.
