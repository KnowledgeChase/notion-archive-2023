# Tasks, Sprints, and Projects

### Tasks

Tasks are the smallest unit of work in your project management tracker. A Task represents a more granular piece of work, often assigned to just one person. Many Tasks can be organized into a Project, or added to a Sprint. 

### Projects

Projects are typically made up of tasks. A Project represents a large body of work, such as a product launch, or a team milestone. A Project can be broken down into many Tasks, and contain customizable properties such as Status. 

### Sprints

Sprints are another dimension by which you can organize tasks and projects, commonly used in Agile workflows. A sprint represents a discrete cycle of time in which tasks will be completed. You can configure start and end dates per Sprint, and assign each Task to a Sprint.

# Adding custom fields

We‚Äôve pre-populated this template with the most common project management fields (like task status and assignee), but you can add your own when you are creating a new field. You‚Äôll have options like priority, estimates, and task type.

# Views, filters, and sorts

Views are customizable, flexible layouts to visualize your databases and properties as a table, board, calendar, timeline, or list. This template comes with several views of Projects, Tasks, and Sprints ‚Äî you can customize each or create your own!
