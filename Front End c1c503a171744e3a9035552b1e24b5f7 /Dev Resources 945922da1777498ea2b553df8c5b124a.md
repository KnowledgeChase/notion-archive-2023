Design References

    One of the things we'll need to figure out soon(ish) is a proper color scheme and font(s) that we want to use. This will tie into the design principles that we'll implement throughout the app
    
    Once we have these things figured out I'll put together a style guide that we can reference whenever we're developing to make sure things stay consistent
    
    to give you an idea of what that will look like here's an example
