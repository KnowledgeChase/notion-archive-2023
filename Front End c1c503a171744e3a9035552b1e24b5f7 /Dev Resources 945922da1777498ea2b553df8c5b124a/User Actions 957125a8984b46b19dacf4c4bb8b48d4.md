# User Actions

The KC app should allow users to act in 3 different roles: hosts, judges, and participants.   A user who creates a contest is referred to as a host; we refer to judges as users who are authorized to judge a mission on behalf of a host; and a participant is a user who has joined a contest and will be completing missions.

Below are some of the actions that each class of user should be able to perform.
