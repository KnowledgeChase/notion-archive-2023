    As developers we need to know which framework to use so that are contributions are compatible.
    
    As a front end developer I need to know the routing and layout from initial page to (dashboard/default page?) and other pages of the app so that I can visualize it and implement it.
    
    As a front end developer I need a CSS framework (set of variables, classes, etc) to use in development to create a consistent site experience.
    
    As a user I want to see a header bar with the following buttons: sign-up, log in, (log out - if logged in), theme (sun, moon), and site pages, so that I can easily navigate the app.
    
    As a front end developer I need the routing and page templates created so that I can add components to the app.
    
    As a developer I need to know the common design principals (shape, styling, look and feel) for creating cards/containers for data and other common components to to ensure consistency in design and less duplication in the¬†CSS.
    
    As a front end developer I need to provide implementation for Signing Up through a menu with restrictions on what the user can use as a password so the user can use the site.
    
    As a front end developer Logging In, and Logging Out through menus and forms so that the user can access their data and use the rest of the website.
    
    As a front end developer I need a way to let the user know when an error has occurred so that the user can know what to do next.
    
    - Eg: If the user types in the wrong password, it will say incorrect password and they will know to try again.
        - email already taken
        - invalid login credentials
        - etc.
    - Could be done like a notification: slides down from the top of the screen and then disappears after a set amount of time without blocking the use of the website

    - As a back end developer I need to maintain server-side endpoint documentation so the front end developers know how to request and access the server.
    - As back end developers we need to decide what kind of database to use so we can start being able to store user data when they create an account.  Potential options: SQL, MongoDB, etc.
    - As a back end developer I need to provide implementation for a user to be able to Sign Up (create an account with validation for passwords)
    - As a back end developer I need to Log In a user and provide them with an access token, so that future requests can be authenticated.
    - As a back end developer I need to Log Out a user and invalidate the access token, so that someone can‚Äôt access the data without signing back in.

        - Need to add login/signup/logout to header bar on main page

            - this will have the same header bar as the home page
            - Additional content that needs to be displayed here: (these can be pages or components/popup windows)
                - view profile + button to switch to an editable profile page
                - create contest
                - list/search contests
                - view invitations (maybe as an icon in the header and it brings down a list with your notifications, so you can quickly see without going to another page)
                - view pending missions
                - (these things also could be displayed in a tile like format on the main/dashboard page
        - View profile page + edit profile
        - Create contest page/component (maybe better as a large popup window the people can hit cancel and go right back to the page they were on)

    **Done:** Restrict cohosts from using PATCH /contest/:id
    
    **Done**: Add a tally of the submissions submitted by each user to each mission.
    
    - Create **SubmissionsTally** schema.
    
    ```jsx
    SubmissionsTally { 
    	userId: User._id, 
    	pending: Number, 
    	approved: Number, 
    	rejected: Number 
    }
    ```
    
    - Add to Mission model **tallies: SubmissionsTally[]**.
    - Modify POST /contest/:cid/mission/:mid/submission.  When a contestant submits a mission submission a SubmissionTally object is added to tallies or updated.
    - Modify GET /contest/:id to return user‚Äôs submissionTally
    - Modify PATCH /contest/:cid/mission/:mid/adjudication/.  When a submission is adjudicated, update SubmissionTally.
    - Modify PATCH /contest/:cid/mission/:mid/submission/:sid.  If submission is changed from rejected to pending, update SubmissionTally.
    - Modify PATCH /contest/:cid/mission/:mid/user-list-upload. When a judge submits uploads a list of contestants a SubmissionTally object is added to tallies or updated to each contestant.
    - Modify DELETE /contest/:cid/mission/:mid/submission/:sid so that the tally is updated when a contestant deletes a pending or rejected submission.
    
    **Done**: Create endpoint to get submissions with pagination and filters. Response includes count. Filters include: skip, status, asc/desc, ~~search (mission title)~~.
    
    - Remove submissions from GET /contests.
    - Create GET /submissions endpoint (see API docs)
    
    **Done**: Send error code when a user tries to login with an unverified account
    
    - Response has status code 401
    
    **Done**: Add option when host creates contest to make themselves a judge of all missions by default or not.
    
    - Add to Contest model **hostJudgesAllMissions: Boolean** (default true).
    - Modify POST /contest/{cid}/mission to set host as judge if hostJudgesAllMissions is true.
    - Modify PATCH /contest/{cid}/mission/{mid} to prevent cohosts from removing host as judge if hostJudgesAllMissions is true.
    
    **Done**: Add option when host/cohost creates mission to make themselves a judge. 
    
    - Add query string (**setUserAsJudge:Boolean** (default true) to POST /contest/{cid}/mission.
    
    **Done**: Allow a host to transfer full ownership of contest to a cohost.
    
    - Create new endpoint: PATCH /contest/{cid}/ownership which takes the cohostId in the request body, sets the cohost as the host, and sets the host as a cohost. Notification is sent to new host.
    
    **Done:** Add some piece of information to be sent back from GET contest so that when a user clicks ‚ÄúRequest to Join Contest‚Äù and they come back at a later time to view that contest, there is some piece of data such as ‚ÄúrequestSent: boolean‚Äù to instead display that their request is pending.
    
    - Modify GET /contest/{id} to include the following added property:
        
        ```jsx
        status: {
        	hosting: Boolean,
        	coHosting: Boolean,
        	invitedToCohost: Boolean,
        	invitedToParticipate: Boolean,
        	participationRequestPending: Boolean
        }
        ```
        
    
    **Done**: Make retrieving list of multiple contests also include how many pages possible there are, that way if the user keeps trying to go to the next page the last one won‚Äôt be blank, also possibly to provide navigation to go to page: 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶ 5
    
    - GET /contests and GET /contests/hosted returns the following object:
    
    ```jsx
    {
    	contests: [],
    	total: Number
    }
    ```
    
    **Done**: ‚ÄúSearch contests that I‚Äôm in‚Äù, I think this is useful but at the moment the implimentation is getting the userdata then looping through the contest id‚Äôs and getting all their data then creating the html list on screen which is not great.
    
    Add query param for private to search all contests so that will include private contest‚Äôs that you are a part of and have access to see.
    
    - (modified) Add `private=true|false` as query string to GET /contests.  Omitting private query string will retrieve public and private contests.

    - **Create BETA global in app.js**
    - **Create Administrator model { email, password, firstName, lastName, phone }**
    - **Add admin/administrators.js router file with POST /admin, POST /admin/login, POST /admin/logout routes.**
