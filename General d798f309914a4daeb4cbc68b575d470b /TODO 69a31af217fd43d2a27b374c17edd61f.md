### General Features

- Implement “Reporting” feature that allows users to report inappropriate content.
- Allow users to RSVP to events.***
- Add NoSubmission validation method.
- Allow host to send notification to all contestants.
- Allow host to invite a list of judges to multiple missions. For example invite [”Alpha”, ”Beta”] to [”Mission1”, ”Mission2”, ”Mission3”].
- Create chat feature so hosts and contestants (banned users?) can communicate.
- Consider limitations on the following:
    - number of contests. (current max = 3)
    - number of invitees (maybe max = 50?)
- Add a mission validation method that saves a text based correct answer when a mission is created and when users submitted their answers they are automatically adjudicated against the correct answer.
- Add an option to missions to allow a variable number of points up to a max value to be awarded by the judge.
- Allow hosts/cohosts to upload (or choose from a set we provide) mission icons/graphics that are displayed in each mission.
- Allow users to accept contest invitation using a link in the email they’ve recevied.
- Allow judges to remove self as judge
- Archive deleted missions and provide access to host/cohosts.
- Decide what to do when host deletes their account.  Currently delete account is not implemented.
- Add max completions per mission as opposed to max submissions per user per mission.  (eg. only first 5 approved get points)
- Sanitize form data (front end and backend?)
- Allow the upload of an image for each mission.  Allow hosts to add other attachments to missions.
- Display gallery (thumbnails) of mission submissions.
- Allow contestant to form teams and allow missions tailored to teams.
- Only allow contestants to join if contest is ending in the future.

### Frontend

- Only enable mission create confirm button if title and description have been entered.
- Not urgent:  Clean up CSS, using root variables and creating reusable classes where possible
- Disable submit button if mission has ended.
- Auto format phone number as user is typing in create account.
- Add “The Knowledge Chase” to top of View Contest when in mobile format.
- Idea: Add to each mission small icons with number of accepted, pending, and rejected submissions.
- Determine if in short term it’s possible to make [knowledgechase.xyz](http://knowledgechase.xyz) a progressive app to allow button on home screen.
- Set default mission dates (start: max(today, contestStart; end: contestEnd).
- In the “invitations” tab of the contests page, if you click accept/reject on an invitation, add a visual indication of whether or not the user has successfully accepted/rejected the invite. (Add an animation to the accepted/rejected invite? Create toast noti? Both?)
- Notifications:
    - Animate opening and closing of  notification menu
    - Clean up styling of notification menu to fit with caleb’s CSS

### Backend

- If email is changed, set emailVerified to false and send verification email.
- Add logging system
- Consider setting lifespan of access tokens.
- Determine security risk of allowing various file extensions uploaded to database.
