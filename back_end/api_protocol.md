# Notes

- The [response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) follow the [FRC 9110](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes) standard ([list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml)).
- DateTime strings are transmitted as ISO 8601 strings which can be created using [Date.toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString).   Dates are in UTC time which is 4 hours ahead of EST. For example, 9:00 am on May 12, 2023 can be written with EST time and an offset (**2023-05-12T09:00:00.000-04:00)** or directly in UTC time with ‚ÄòZ‚Äô at the end (**2023-05-12T13:00:00.000Z)** or as you can see in the MongoDB database in UTC time with a 0 offset (**2023-05-12T13:00:00.000+00:00)**. See [Helpful guide](https://dd.engineering/blog/a-guide-to-handling-date-and-time-for-full-stack-javascript-developers#storing-dates-in-the-database) on using dates.
- All routes that require a Bearer token will return status code *401: Unauthorized* if the token is missing or invalid.
